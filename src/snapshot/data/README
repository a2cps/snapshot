A2CPS: the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures project (<https://a2cps.org>)

This NIH funded initiative is generating data on participants who
undergo surgery in order to study chronic pain.

This BIDS dataset is an interim product of the A2CPS project, and
includes pre-surgery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from
pre-surgery on the subset of individuals designated as "Release 1"
(597 cases).

## Background and Policies

See <https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WG/pages/5080376/First+Data+Release> for a
summary of the first release and the procedure for accessing data and
creating publications based on it.

## History

Data collection began in late 2020, and continued during the COVID-19
pandemic, though with fluctuations due to temporary restrictions at
imaging sites. The data included in Release 1 are from subjects with
surgeries completed by February 2023.

## Overview

The various data collection components of A2CPS were intended to
capture possible features that could predict the development of
chronic pain. In the case of imaging, there are structural MRI,
diffusion MRI, and functional MRI scans; for the last, two resting
state scans bracket a pair of scans during which pain was administered
via an inflated leg cuff.

### Subjects

Subjects were patients undergoing one of two surgery types: knee (TKA,
Total Knee Arthroplasty) or thoracic. The numeric part of an A2CPS ID records
MCC (first digit) and surgery type (second digit):

- [ ] 10000-14999: MCC1 TKA
- [ ] 15000-19999: MCC1 Thoracic
- [ ] 20000-24999: MCC2 Thoracic
- [ ] 25000-29999: MCC2 TKA

### Task organization

The two tasks used a subject-specific cuff pressure (CUFF1) and a
standard pressure (CUFF2). In some cases, administration of cuff
pressure was contraindicated entirely, or the standard pressure was
too high to be tolerated, so that one or both of the Cuff scans were
skipped. In cases where both were skipped, the imaging protocol
allowed REST2 to be skipped as well, though it was occasionally
collected (especially prior to this being formalized in the
protocol).

Tasks were not counter-balanced. Counterbalancing would be desirable
in some respects, but posed a standardization issue across sites and
would have added a potential failure point. In addition, which is more
painful may vary across patients in ways hard to predict. We thus kept
the runs in the same order, with pressure calibrated to pain-40 (P40)
first and a standard intensity (120 mm Hg) second.

Recording of patient pain ratings was interspersed between the fMRIs.

### Additional data acquired

The project includes collection of blood samples (for proteomics,
lipidomics, metabolomics, exRNA, and gene variant measures),
psychosocial questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and
functional testing measures, and medical record (EHR) data.

### Experimental location

MRIs were collected at six imaging sites organized in two consortia
("multi-site clinical centers", or MCCs):

MCC1: Chicago, Illinois

- [ ] UI: University of Illinois Chicago
- [ ] UC: University of Chicago
- [ ] NS: NorthShore University HealthSystem

MCC2: Michigan

- [ ] UM: University of Michigan (2 scanners)
- [ ] WS: Wayne State University
- [ ] SH: Corewell Health (formerly Spectrum Health)/Michigan State University Grand Rapids

### Site specific variations in protocols

In general, the A2CPS project used the protocol developed by the ABCD
study, and in some cases used ABCD MRI sequences directly. However, on
older scanners some adjustments were required. Please see the Release
Notes for details.

### Further Details

Further details on the procedures for cuff pain administration, recruitment criteria, and
other points can be found in the Method of Procedures manual (MOP).
