A2CPS: the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures project (<https://a2cps.org>)

This NIH funded initiative is generating data on participants who
undergo surgery in order to study chronic pain.

This BIDS dataset is an interim product of the A2CPS project, and
includes pre-surgery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from
pre-surgery on the subset of individuals designated as "Release 1"
(597 cases).

## Background and Policies

See <https://confluence.a2cps.org/display/WG/First+Data+Release> for a
summary of the first release and the procedure for accessing data and
creating publications based on it.

## DataLad Access

This is a DataLad dataset (id: 220fbe98-2d7c-411d-a419-32213ec8dfef).

### DataLad datasets and how to use them

This repository is a [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) dataset. It provides
fine-grained data access down to the level of individual files, and allows for
tracking future updates. In order to use this repository for data retrieval,
[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) is required. It is a free and open source
command line tool, available for all major operating systems, and builds up on
Git and [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) to allow sharing,
synchronizing, and version controlling collections of large files.

More information on how to install DataLad and [how to install](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html)
it can be found in the [DataLad Handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/index.html).

### Get the dataset

A DataLad dataset can be `cloned` by running

```
datalad clone <url>
```

Once a dataset is cloned, it is a light-weight directory on your local machine.
At this point, it contains only small metadata and information on the identity
of the files in the dataset, but not actual *content* of the (sometimes large)
data files.

### Retrieve dataset content

After cloning a dataset, you can retrieve file contents by running

```
datalad get <path/to/directory/or/file>
```

This command will trigger a download of the files, directories, or subdatasets
you have specified.

DataLad datasets can contain other datasets, so called *subdatasets*.  If you
clone the top-level dataset, subdatasets do not yet contain metadata and
information on the identity of files, but appear to be empty directories. In
order to retrieve file availability metadata in subdatasets, run

```
datalad get -n <path/to/subdataset>
```

Afterwards, you can browse the retrieved metadata to find out about subdataset
contents, and retrieve individual files with `datalad get`.  If you use
`datalad get <path/to/subdataset>`, all contents of the subdataset will be
downloaded at once.

### Stay up-to-date

DataLad datasets can be updated. The command `datalad update` will *fetch*
updates and store them on a different branch (by default
`remotes/origin/master`). Running

```
datalad update --merge
```

will *pull* available updates and integrate them in one go.

### Find out what has been done

DataLad datasets contain their history in the ``git log``.  By running ``git
log`` (or a tool that displays Git history) in the dataset or on specific
files, you can find out what has been done to the dataset or to individual
files by whom, and when.

## History

Data collection began in late 2020, and continued during the COVID-19
pandemic, though with fluctuations due to temporary restrictions at
imaging sites. The data included in Release 1 are from subjects with
surgeries completed by February 2023.

## Overview

The various data collection components of A2CPS were intended to
capture possible features that could predict the development of
chronic pain. In the case of imaging, there are structural MRI,
diffusion MRI, and functional MRI scans; for the last, two resting
state scans bracket a pair of scans during which pain was administered
via an inflated leg cuff.

### BIDS Information

Summary:             Available Tasks:     Available Modalities:
9039 Files, 335.1GB  cuff                 MRI
361 - Subject        rest
1 - Session

### Subjects

Subjects were patients undergoing one of two surgery types: knee (TKA,
Total Knee Arthroplasty) or thoracic. The numeric part of an A2CPS ID records
MCC (first digit) and surgery type (second digit):

- [ ] 10000-14999: MCC1 TKA
- [ ] 15000-19999: MCC1 Thoracic
- [ ] 20000-24999: MCC2 Thoracic
- [ ] 25000-29999: MCC2 TKA

### Task organization

The two tasks used a subject-specific cuff pressure (CUFF1) and a
standard pressure (CUFF2). In some cases, administration of cuff
pressure was contraindicated entirely, or the standard pressure was
too high to be tolerated, so that one or both of the Cuff scans were
skipped. In cases where both were skipped, the imaging protocol
allowed REST2 to be skipped as well, though it was occasionally
collected (especially prior to this being formalized in the
protocol).

Tasks were not counter-balanced. Counterbalancing would be desirable
in some respects, but posed a standardization issue across sites and
would have added a potential failure point. In addition, which is more
painful may vary across patients in ways hard to predict. We thus kept
the runs in the same order, with pressure calibrated to pain-40 (P40)
first and a standard intensity (115 mm Hg) second.

Recording of patient pain ratings was interspersed between the fMRIs.

### Additional data acquired

The project includes collection of blood samples (for proteomics,
lipidomics, metabolomics, exRNA, and gene variant measures),
psychosocial questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and
functional testing measures, and medical record (EHR) data.

### Experimental location

MRIs were collected at six imaging sites organized in two consortia
("multi-site clinical centers", or MCCs):

MCC1: Chicago, Illinois

- [ ] UI: University of Illinois Chicago
- [ ] UC: University of Chicago
- [ ] NS: NorthShore University HealthSystem

MCC2: Michigan

- [ ] UM: University of Michigan (2 scanners)
- [ ] WS: Wayne State University
- [ ] SH: Corewell Health (formerly Spectrum Health)/Michigan State University Grand Rapids

### Site specific variations in protocols

In general, the A2CPS project used the protocol developed by the ABCD
study, and in some cases used ABCD MRI sequences directly. However, on
older scanners some adjustments were required. Please see the Release
Notes for details.

### Further Details

Further details on the procedures for cuff pain administration, recruitment criteria, and
other points can be found in the Method of Procedures manual (MOP).
